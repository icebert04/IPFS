# IPFS (from [learnweb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/junior))

## Things that I've learned..

* Built a NFT collection and stored its metadata on **Pinata (IPFS)**
* There are only 10 unique NFTs that can be minted
* We get the CID of the metadata from **Pinata**
* Used **Hardhat** for smart contract deployment, as well as importing **Openzeppelin's Contracts**
* Got API keys from **[Alchemy]**(https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and **[Mumbai Faucet]**(https://chainlist.org/)
* npm install **Web3Modal library** in order to connect DeFI dApp to the **Metamask** wallet
* The NFT contract is deployed to the **Polygon** testnet **Mumbai**  
 
Here's a screenshot of the NFT collection in **IPFS** that I've built..
